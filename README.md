## Blood Distribution Web Application

## Overview

This project aims to develop a web application dedicated to modeling the distribution of blood groups across hospitals in Morocco. In a context of growing blood demand in the country, the fundamental goal is to optimize the management of the national blood stock by establishing a responsive system to efficiently meet urgent patient demands.

The central problem explores how this application can improve the supply chain by simplifying the processes of blood search and inventory while establishing a rapid notification system for citizens with a required blood group in case of emergencies. The study of this project consists of several stages, starting with the analysis of the requirements and functionalities defined in the specifications document, followed by system modeling using SysML diagrams, and finally, the development of the system using various web development technologies.

## Key Features
